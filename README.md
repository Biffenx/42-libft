# libft
Hive Helsinki project.

**Why?**

Hive Helsinki and other 42 schools forbid the use of C standard library, so the first real task is to create your very own library containing functions you can use in your future projects.

**Contents**

First this library consisted of bootleg versions of functions found in libc, but I have also made some improvements and additional functions after passing the assigment. Some of the improvements have been so radical that this project does not meet with the completion requirements of the original 42 libft assigment anymore.
