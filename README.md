# libft
Hive Helsinki project.

**What?**  
Bootleg version of C standard library and more. The functions are logically divided into subdirectories and every subdirectory has its own header file.

**Why?**  
Hive Helsinki and other 42 schools forbid the use of most C standard library functions, so the first real task is to create your very own library containing functions you can use in future projects.
