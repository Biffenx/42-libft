# libft
Hive Helsinki project.

**What?**  
Collection of useful functions. The functions are divided into subfolders and every folder has its own header file.

**Why?**  
Hive Helsinki and other 42 schools forbid the use of C standard library, so the first real task is to create your very own library containing functions you can use in your future projects.
